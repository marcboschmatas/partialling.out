Partialling out is a package that allows to generate residualised
variables of already existing linear or fixed effects models. So far it
works with `lm`, `felm` (`lfe`package) and `feols` (`fixest` package)
for applications of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem, as explained in
Lovell ([2008](doi:10.3200/JECE.39.1.88-91)). Whereas this algorithm has
already been implemented in
[`fwlplot`](https://github.com/kylebutts/fwlplot), this package offers
three new characteristics.

- It uses an already existing model instead of a formula.

- Works with `lm` and `felm` objects alongside `feols`.

- Returns a data.frame with residualised variables instead of a plot,
  thus offering more freedom of what to do with the results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of partialling.out from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("marcboschmatas/partialling.out")
```

## Examples

The workflow for `partialling.out` is rather simple: first, create a
linear or fixed effects model.

``` r
library(partialling.out)
library(tinytable)
library(tinyplot)
library(palmerpenguins)

model <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm + species, data = penguins)
summary(model)
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm + species, data = penguins)
#> 
#> Residuals:
#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
#> -8.0300 -1.5828  0.0733  1.6925 10.0313 
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#>                  Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
#> (Intercept)       13.2164     2.2475    5.88 9.83e-09 ***
#> bill_depth_mm      1.3940     0.1220   11.43  < 2e-16 ***
#> speciesChinstrap   9.9390     0.3678   27.02  < 2e-16 ***
#> speciesGentoo     13.4033     0.5118   26.19  < 2e-16 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#> 
#> Residual standard error: 2.518 on 338 degrees of freedom
#>   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
#> Multiple R-squared:  0.7892, Adjusted R-squared:  0.7874 
#> F-statistic: 421.9 on 3 and 338 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

Using the `partialling_out` function, you can get the residualised
variable of interest (bill length) and of the first explanatory variable
(bill_length), i.e. it would return the residuals of the following two
regressions.

``` r
modely <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
modelx <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```

``` r
res <- partialling_out(model, data = penguins)

tt(head(res)) |>
  format_tt(digits = 2) |>
  style_tt(align = "c")
```

| res_bill_length_mm | res_bill_depth_mm |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| 0.31               | 0.35              |
| 0.71               | -0.95             |
| 1.51               | -0.35             |
| -2.09              | 0.95              |
| 0.51               | 2.25              |
| 0.11               | -0.55             |

## Checking the results

The Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem states that for a linear model

``` math
Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + u
```

The coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$ will be equivalent to the coefficient,
$\tilde{\beta}_1$, from the regression of

``` math
M_{X_2} Y = M_{X_2} X_1 \beta_1 + M_{X_1} u
```

Where $M_{X_2} Y$ are the residuals of the regression of $Y$ on $X_2$
and $M_{X_2}X_1$ are the residuals of the regression of $X_1$ on $X_2$.

<br/> Accordingly, the coefficient of `res_bill_depth_mm` in the model
`lm(res_bill_length_mm ~ res_bill_depth_mm)` will be the same of the
coefficient of `bill_depth_mm` in the original model.

``` r
resmodel <- lm(res_bill_length_mm ~ res_bill_depth_mm, data = res)

print(c(model$coefficients[2], resmodel$coefficients[2]))
#>     bill_depth_mm res_bill_depth_mm 
#>          1.394011          1.394011
```

Partialling out is a package that allows to generate residualised variables of already existing linear or fixed effects models. So far it works with `lm`, `felm` (`lfe`package) and `feols`  (`fixest` package) for applications of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem, as explained in Lovell ([2008](doi:10.3200/JECE.39.1.88-91)). Whereas this algorithm has already been implemented in [`fwlplot`](https://github.com/kylebutts/fwlplot), this package offers three new characteristics.

- It uses an already existing model instead of a formula.

- Works with `lm` and `felm` objects alongside `feols`.

- Returns a data.frame with residualised variables instead of a plot, thus offering more freedom of what to do with the results.


## Installation

You can install the development version of partialling.out from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("marcboschmatas/partialling.out")
```



## Examples

The workflow for `partialling.out` is rather simple: first, create a linear or fixed effects model.

```{r}
library(partialling.out)
library(tinytable)
library(tinyplot)
library(palmerpenguins)

model <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm + species, data = penguins)
summary(model)
```

Using the `partialling_out` function, you can get the residualised variable of interest (bill length) and of the first explanatory variable (bill_length), i.e. it would return the residuals of the following two regressions.

```{r eval = FALSE}
modely <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
modelx <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```



```{r}
res <- partialling_out(model, data = penguins)

tt(head(res)) |>
  format_tt(digits = 2) |>
  style_tt(align = "c")
```


## Checking the results

The Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem states that for a linear model

``` math
Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + u
```

The coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$ will be equivalent to the coefficient, $\tilde{\beta}_1$, from the regression of

``` math
M_{X_2} Y = M_{X_2} X_1 \beta_1 + M_{X_1} u
```

Where $M_{X_2} Y$ are the residuals of the regression of $Y$ on $X_2$ and 
$M_{X_2}X_1$ are the residuals of the regression of $X_1$ on $X_2$.

<br/>
Accordingly, the coefficient of `res_bill_depth_mm` in the model `lm(res_bill_length_mm ~ res_bill_depth_mm)` will be the same of the coefficient of `bill_depth_mm` in the original model.

```{r}
resmodel <- lm(res_bill_length_mm ~ res_bill_depth_mm, data = res)

print(c(model$coefficients[2], resmodel$coefficients[2]))
```
